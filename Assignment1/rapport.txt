Presedence
Presedence is handled by with chainl1 in the expr and by chaining the
nonterminals. That is making the lower presedence expresion call the higher
ones to create a syntax tree with the highest presendece operations lowest on
the trees, thereby forcing them to evaluation first.

Left recursion
Left recursion is handled by poping the left side of the expresions and
parsing the variable to the function that reads what operation is performed.

Tests
We made a test file called CurvyTest.hs that runs 5 tests that should parse
and 4 that should not. The tests can be seen in CurvyTest.hs and it is commented what we
tested for in each of the tests. The tests can be run with the function "test"
